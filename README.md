Home Tutor Booking System
The Home Tutor Booking System is an online platform designed to connect parents (students) with teachers for personalized tutoring sessions. The system allows parents to recruit teachers, manage their assignments, and track tutor engagement.

Key Features:
Parent Functions:
Teacher Recruitment: Parents must first register on the platform. Once registered, they can recruit teachers online. After successfully recruiting a teacher, parents will receive an SMS with the teacher's contact information and the subjects they will be teaching.

Teacher Removal: Parents have the ability to remove a teacher from their assigned list at any time. When a teacher is removed, the system sends an SMS notification to the parent, confirming that the teacher has been removed.

Manage Tutor Assignments: Parents can view assigned subjects, contact tutors, and ensure that their children are matched with the right educators.

Admin Functions:
Register Teachers: Admins can add teachers to the system, assign them subjects, and manage teacher profiles.

View All Users: Admins have full control over the platform, allowing them to see all users (parents and teachers) and manage assignments and user roles.

Teacher Functions:
Login and Update Credentials: Teachers can log in to the system, manage their profiles, and update their credentials.

Create & Manage Content: Teachers can upload teaching materials, assignments, and resources related to their subjects.
